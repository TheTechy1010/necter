<h4>
I am very much confused with my carrer right now.
i have already taken admission into SUIIT. Now my
expected State B.Ed entrance marks is 90. So i think 
and it might happen that i may get a seat in SCERT's 
2year B.Ed Programme. But the final merit list id not
published yet & i am right now at my home village because
there is a big chance of getting a seat in SCERT. More people i
talk to they are saying you will get a seat in B.ed but , presonally
i have pretty much no interest in doing the same course. But i have not 
elected in Msc Physcics it is Msc in Electronics which has a very less
scope but i have interest in that because it is technical course and i wanna 
be a techy.
